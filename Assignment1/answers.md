(1) Decide what platform you will be using, i.e. what hardware (i.e. macbook, pc, cray, etc.) and what programming language (e.g. Java, Python, C++, Javascript, Lisp, etc.)?

Ans: We will be programming in Java and running on a Macbook Pro and possibly a PC, if workable.

(2) Connect to Arena. Click on the Arena link in the commandbar above. Then click the Games link. Look at some of the games recorded there. Click on a two-player game, click Play the Game, and play a match with a teammate. The point of the exercise is to become familiar with the practice of learning and playing new games. Submit a record of the match you played. (Click on History then copy and paste the history table into the box below.)

(3) Extra Credit: Consider the broader implications of General Game Playing. Come up with a practical application where GGP techniques would be applicable. Hint: Consider situations in which rules of behavior can be codified formally and where those rules come from multiple sources or change frequently. Summarize your application and the reasons why General Game Playing is applicable.

Ans: 	Robotics, particularly manufacturing and medical robotics, could benefit from GGP. In medicine, each surgery is under very different rules (what organs are safe to contact, what the objective is) and has different objectives (remove, mend, cauterize), so a GGP agent could be versatile enough to succeed regardless of the specific case. In manufacturing, a robot could be programmed with a GGP algorithm to allow it to work on various different construction projects without domain-specific instructions.

(4) Extra Credit: Invent a simple (but non-trivial) game of your own. Write a GDL rulesheet for the game. Create a Javascript stylesheet for your game. (Look at the games in Arena for some examples of rulesheets and stylesheets.) Use the Gametester to play a match of your game. Note that you will need to paste your rulesheet and stylesheet into the Game pane of the Gametester page in order for them to be used. Then click Initialize and play away. Submit an English description of your game. Be prepared to show your rulesheet and stylesheet to the TAs.

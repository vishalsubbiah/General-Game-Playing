* Shift to the forward propagation /differential propagation
* Look into better garbage collector for java (to reduce errors)
* compare the number of depth charges for 4 connect (with back propagation one team got 100000 with propnet) 2800 depthcharges per second for pentago
* Test with and without cachestatemachine ( cachestatemachine should slow us down as we improve our propnet)
* multithreading
* add choosing random move if error in finding a move
* What are we using the metagame time for (apart from building the propnet)
* set parent node to null so that we dont need to backtrack as much so we can launch more depthcharges
